            <h1>Ciamis Regency</h1>
            <p>Ciamis Regency (Indonesian: Kabupaten Ciamis, Sundanese) is a landlocked regency in West Java, Indonesia,
                and shares a provincial border with Central Java.</p>
            <p><img src="./Assets/ciamis-icon.png" alt="Ciamis" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
                Its seat is the town of Ciamis, also the primary urban center. Formerly, the regency included the town
                of Banjar, which was separated out to become an independent city on 11 December 2002; it also included
                areas bordering the Indian Ocean, but these southern districts were cut off to form a separate
                Pangandaran Regency on 25 October 2012. The regency now covers 1,597.67 km2, and had a 2020 census
                population of 1,229,069,[2]> but the official estimate as at mid 2022 was 1,247,768.</p>

                    style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
                Prior to the separation of part of this regency in 2012, it had an area of 2,556.75 km2 and population
                of 1,528,306 (at the 2010 census); the regency was until 2012 divided into 36 districts. However, as
                from 25 October 2012, the existing regency has been split, with 10 districts comprising the southern
                portion being formed into a new Pangandaran Regency in the extreme southeast of the province (with a
                2010 census population of 383,848), leaving 26 districts in the residual Ciamis Regency. The reduced
                Ciamis Regency covers 1,597.67 km2 and the districts comprising it had a population of 1,148,656 at the
                2010 census,[3] which rose to 1,229,069 at the 2020 census[2] and to an official estimate of 1,247,768
                as at mid 2022
